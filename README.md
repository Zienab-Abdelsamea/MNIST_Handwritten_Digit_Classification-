The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9

# Digit Recognition Using MNIST
Our task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively using a CNN that will be able to recognize the handwritten digits. CNN is a type of deep neural network commonly used for computer vision applications. So we will build an image classifier TensorFlow’s Keras API on the MNIST dataset. Keras is a Python library and is highly recommended for beginners due to its smooth learning curve. It is very commonly used in implementing neural networks.
